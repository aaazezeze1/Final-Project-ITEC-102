# Final Project ITEC 102
Cube Escape - "Try to Evade and Escape",  is our Final Project in ITEC 102 (Fundamentals of Programming). 
This simple C# console game is made by Amazing Grace Cabiles, Cyrelle Gapit, and Francen Manalo from BSCS-1B.

This game is like the classic snake game with a twist. Instead of collecting "fruits", you are supposed to 
dodge "blocks". You lose if you go out of the border or hit a block.

#  What we used for the project
1. Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio Community 2022
2. .NET 6 (Long Term Support)
3. Built in Libraries of C#

# What to do before starting the game
Download Visual Studio Code or Visual Studio Community Edtion and download .NET 6. If you use Visual Studio Code you need to
download .NET 6 manually and install the recommended extensions for C#. Once you download .NET and open Visual Studio Code 
it will detect that you have .NET 6 in your machine once you create a .cs file and will ask you if you want to download the
recommended C# extensions from Microsoft so download them. This game is built using .NET 6 which is the Long Term Support 
release and the code might not work on lower or higher .NET versions. You can use other code editors but we recommend you 
use Visual Studio Code to easily download .NET.

If you have Windows 11 installed on your machine, go to the Settings app and then go to System. Scroll down and go to For Developers. 
Scroll down again and you will see that the Terminal option is set to Let Windows decide by default. Click on the drop down menu and
choose Windows Console Host. If you use Windows 10 or lower, we recommend you still check the Settings app to check if you are using
the Old Windows Terminal (Windows Console Host) or the new Windows Terminal. What this does is use the Windows Console Host instead 
of the new Windows Terminal. When the new Windows Terminal is used the code for resizing the console window will not work because 
Windows by default will try to maximize the Terminal Window.
